{"name":"USM","tagline":"Teaching Material for the MSc Course Environmental Modelling (Umweltsystemmodellierung)","body":"## Objective\r\n\r\nThis course provides an introduction to working with complex models, where complex here means large systems with many interdependencies such as the atmosphere, the biosphere, the economic system or an ecosystem. The aim is to learn how to understand and communicate model structure and principles, explore sensitivities and uncertainties, establish the domain at which the model is valid, and communicate and discuss results.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nBasic Knowledge of statistics, programming (R) and (ecological) modeling\r\n\r\n## Topics\r\n\r\nDesign and analysis of complex models (global circulation models, earth system models, (global) dynamic vegetation models, ecosystem models, macroeconomic models, “world” models); parameter estimation, validation, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis, visualization.\r\n\r\n## Information for course participants summer term 15\r\n\r\n* [Syllabus 2015](https://github.com/florianhartig/USM/raw/master/Syllabus/Syllabus_MSc-USM_2015.pdf), including Link to sign up at ILIAS\r\n\r\n\r\n## Past Courses\r\n\r\n* Summer semester 13 (MSc, 3 week full-time)\r\n* Summer semester 14 (MSc, 3 week full-time)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
